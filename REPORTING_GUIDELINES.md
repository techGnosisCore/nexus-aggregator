# Reporting Guidelines

The purpose of these guidelines is to provide clear and confidential instructions for reporting any incidents or violations of our communityâ€™s Code of Conduct.

## Why Reporting Matters

Timely and detailed reports help us maintain a safe and respectful community by ensuring that issues are addressed promptly and fairly.

## How to Report an Incident

1. **Document the Incident**
   - Record a detailed description of the incident including date, time, context, and individuals involved.
   - Gather any supporting evidence such as screenshots, links, or logs.

2. **Submit Your Report**
   - **Email:** Send your report to our dedicated email address: [techGnosisCore@proton.me](mailto:techGnosisCore@proton.me)  
     *(Email might change when community grows)*
   - **Anonymous Reporting:** If you prefer to remain anonymous, please use our anonymous reporting form: [Anonymous Reporting Form](https://example.com/anonymous-report)  
     *(Link will be updated when the form is ready)*
   - **GitHub Issues:** Alternatively, you can open an issue in the [nexus-aggregator Issues section](https://github.com/techGnosisCore/nexus-aggregator/issues) using the label **"code-of-conduct violation"**.  
     *Note:* Reporting via GitHub will make the report public, so consider using this method only if you are comfortable with that.
